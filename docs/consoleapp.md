# Sample 1 - console app

In a `sample1` directory, run

```
mkdir sample1 && cd sample1
```

### dotnet new

Now let's create a console app 

RUN

```
dotnet new console -lang f#
```

let's open code to inspect it, run

```
code .
```

A normal console app is:
- a `sample1.fsproj`: the project file.
- a `Program.fs`: the source file

Open the `Program.fs` in the editor

This is the entrypoint of the of the program, the `main` and the args passed to the console app

When ionide is started, it make the `F# PROJECT EXPLORER` visible on the left panels.
This contains the projects loaded

![project explorer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ionide_project_explorer.png)

Now, let's build it.
It can be done in the the terminal

**TIP** code has an embedded terminal. Open it with `View -> Integrated Terminal`

### dotnet build

run

```
dotnet build
```

This compile the project and show the output:

```
Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.1.76+g14b0a930a7 for .NET Core
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  Restore completed in 25.58 ms for C:\thor-w\sample1\sample1.fsproj.
  sample1 -> C:\thor-w\sample1\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\sample1.dll

Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

Time Elapsed 00:00:02.72
```

So the output is `bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/sample1.dll`

To run it:

```
dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/sample1.dll
```

Now let's pass some arguments.
First change the program to print the arguments.

DO add to the main

```
printfn "%A" argv
```

### dotnet run

Now another time, compile and execute. Run:

```
dotnet build
dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/sample1.dll a b --other a
```

A faster way to do it, is use `dotnet run` command, who does the same thing

```
dotnet run -- a b
```

### dotnet publish

What if i want to use my app in another machine?

Two possibilities of deployment:

- `framework dependent` (FDD)
  - CONS require .net core runtime installed in target machine
  - CONS executed as `dotnet app.dll`
  - CONS bundle all the native deps for all os
  - PRO same binaries for all os
  - PRO small size of binaries
- `self contained` (SCD)
  - CONS bigger size of binaries
  - CONS distinct binaries for all os
  - PRO is a normal native app (`app.exe` or `app`)
  - PRO doesnt require .net core runtime installed on target machine
  - CONS require .net core deps (like libunwind, see docs) installed

### First let's try FDD

Run 

```
dotnet publish
```

This create the `bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/` directory
who can be copied in another machine, and run with

```
dotnet sample1.dll
```

For example directly from WSL with

```
dotnet /mnt/c/thor-w/sample1/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/sample1.dll d e
```

### Now a SCD, in another directory

Run 

```
dotnet publish --runtime win-x64 --output out
```

and that directory `out` contains `sample1.exe` you can run directly as `out\sample1.exe 1 2 3`

Doing the same for osx

```
dotnet publish --runtime osx-x64 --output outosx
```

Or linux, run

```
dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -o outlinux -c Release
```

NOTE on linux .net core apps has some requirements, like the `libunwind` package installed (see docs)

NOTE to know your local os runtime id (called `RID` like `osx-64`), just do `dotnet --info`

```
Runtime Environment:
 OS Name:     Windows
 OS Version:  10.0.17763
 OS Platform: Windows
 RID:         win10-x64
 Base Path:   C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\2.1.701\
```

**NOTE** is possibile to bundle these deps as local copies, ref https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/self-contained-linux-apps.md


**NOTE** the runtime can be specified also in the fsproj

```xml
    <RuntimeIdentifiers>win10-x64;osx-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
```

### Ionide vscode integration

To run it in debugging, without any setting, just:

- Set a breakpoint, in the column on the left of the line
- Right click on the project
- do `Debug`

![project explorer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ionide_run_debug.png)

### VSCode settings

Let's configure VS Code to build/debug this project
VSCode use tasks to run things.

- VSCODE `> Tasks: Configure Default Build Task`
- choose `create task.json from template`
- choose `.NET Core`

If there are no error, default behavior is not show message. you can override with

```
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "always"
            },
```

To run it:

- VSCODE `> Tasks: Run Build Task`
- choose `build`

So now the default run build use that

If there is an error, are shown in `PROBLEMS` tab
You can move between errors with

- VSCODE `> Go to Next Problem`

Now, to debug you can create a `launch.json` with info about debug with:

- `> Debug: Start Debugging`
- choose `.NET Core`
- on the bottom right, click the button `Add Configuration...`
- choose `.NET Core Launch (console)`
- set `program` path to output assembly

now `F5` and `> Debug: continue` will run as usual

### External package

For example we need to parse the command line arguments
We want to use [Argu](http://fsprojects.github.io/Argu/) library

to manage the packages in the project, we can use the `dotnet add` and `dotnet remove` commands

```
dotnet add package Argu
```

this add a packagereference to the project

```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Argu" Version="3.7.0" />
```

and restore the project (download the package).

We can now use argu to manage command line args
First declaring the arguments

```fsharp
open Argu

type CLIArguments =
    | Port of tcp_port:int
with
    interface IArgParserTemplate with
        member s.Usage =
            match s with
            | Port _ -> "specify a primary port."
```

and doing the parsing in the `main`

```fsharp
    let parser = ArgumentParser.Create<CLIArguments>(programName = "sample1")

    try
        let args = parser.Parse argv

        match args.GetAllResults() with
        | [Port p] -> printfn "set port %i" p
        | _ -> ()

        0 // return an integer exit code
    with
    | :? ArguParseException as ex ->
        printfn "%s" ex.Message
        1
    | ex ->
        printfn "Internal Error:"
        printfn "%s" ex.Message
        2
```

to check is working:

```
dotnet run -- --help
dotnet run -- --port 81
```

**NOTE** by default configuration, the `--help` raise an exception in Argu.
Try with debugging, you can see the `ex.ErrorCode` is `HelpText`

### Multi Targeting

The sdk support multi target framework as first class.

Change from

```
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
```

to the **PLURAL**, the is an `s` at end ( <-- **PLURAL** )

```
    <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp2.0;net471</TargetFrameworks>
```

You can add all tfm you want `netcoreapp2.0;net452;net462` etc.
Same for libraries

Now just restore

```
dotnet restore
```

and to build all frameworks, just `dotnet build`
Use `dotnet build -f netcoreapp2.0` to build just one.

All commands (`test`, etc) have a `--framework` of `-f` parameter

You can conditionally add msbuild items (like `Compile`, `PackageReference` or `ProjectReference`) with the attribute `Condition=" '$(TargetFramework)' == 'netcoreapp2.0' "`
